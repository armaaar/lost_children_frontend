# lost_children_frontend

The frontend for the lost children project.

## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed. This project uses [null safety](https://flutter.dev/docs/null-safety) so we recommend the latest stable version of flutter to be used.

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to ease up setting up the project and developping in general. You can refer to flutter's [editor setup](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) documentation.

## Setup

1. Create `.env` file in the project root with the required environment variables. See `.env.example` for list of environment variables.

2. Install all packages: `flutter pub get`

## Structure

This app uses [Atmoic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) to categorize widgets

## TODO list

- Add unit tests
- Add [Semantics](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html)
- Better error messages
- Add i18n
